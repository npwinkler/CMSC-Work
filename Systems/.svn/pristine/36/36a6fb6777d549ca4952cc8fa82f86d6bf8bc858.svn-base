A. (1) Morse code as used for wired telegraphy best fits into the link layer
as it is a transmission of data between 2 hosts connected by the same electric
wire that the data is physically transmitted over
B. (4) HTCPCP is built on top of HTTP, which is itself in the application layer.
Also, it presupposes a stable connection between the client and the coffee pot server/
C. (1) IPoAC best fits into the link layer as it is transmission of data between
2 hosts by a physical means (pigeon) that is a single link.
D. (3) This modified version of TCP would still best fit at the transport layer
as it still allows process-to-process communication, doesn't care about the
underlying network. Making it non-lossless doesn't change it because UDP is also
at the transport layer.
E. /* not sure */ (3) The Security Flag in the IPv4 Header best fits into the
transport layer because it is implement on top of IP, so is at least this high
and doesn't care about the underlying network it just implements when to transfer
messages correctly based on whether or not the evil bit is set.
F. (3) The Licklider Transmission Protocol best fits in with the transport layer
as it already runs over a link layer and it governs making sure which data is sent
how reliably and splits off how applications communicate specific things
G. (2) The UN interpretation service best fits into the internet layer, because it
is providing a conversion between the language spoken by one network of people to
the language spoken by another network of people so that they can communicate
with each other.
H. (4) This white board protocol best fits into the application layer as it's built 
over and presupposes a stable TCP/IP connection and takes the data produced by the
user acting on say, their own computer application at home, and sending it to the
application that determines what the shared white board does.
