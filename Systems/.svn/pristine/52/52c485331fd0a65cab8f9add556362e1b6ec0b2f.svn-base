A. block 2 ( 0 x Tseek + 1 x Trot), then block 19 ( 1 x Tseek + 1 x Trot) = 20ms
/*On outer track, so don't need to move arm then wait until it rotates to 2, 
then move the arm to the inner track & wait until it rotates to 19*/
B. block 3 ( 0 x Tseek + 1 x Trot), then block 20 ( 1 x Tseek + 1 x Trot) = 20ms
/*same logic as A */
C. block 9 ( 1 x Tseek + 1 x Trot), then block 11 ( 1 x Tseek + 1 x Trot) = 30 ms
/* on outer track, so need to move to inner track then wait for rotation to 9,
then move the arm back to outer track and wait for rotation to 11 */

A. yes, there is a (more than one, actually) contiguous 3MB span of virtual memory
where we can put P1, so it can be run. Since we use the lowest addressing, P1 will be
in address range 0-2.

B. Yes, there is a (more than one, actually) contiguous 3MB span of virtual memory
where we can put P2, so it can be run. Since we use the lowest addressing, P2 will be
in address range 5-7.

C. No, there is no contiguous 3MB span of virtual memory where we can put P3
even though there is a total 3MB of memory available, so it cannot be run.

D. P1's internal fragmentation: 2 MB of 3 MB allocated are wasted
P2's internal fragmentation: 1 MB of 3 MB allocated are wasted
P3 isn't run so we don't care about it, but if it could be run it would waste 0MB
So, the total internal fragmentation: 3 MB of 6 MB wasted

E. The external fragmentation is 3 MB wasted out of 10 MB
(These 3 MB are at slot 3 and 8-9)
