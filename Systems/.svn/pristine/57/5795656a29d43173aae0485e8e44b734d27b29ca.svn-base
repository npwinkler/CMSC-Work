Questions were graded by TAs and professors. If you believe a question
was graded incorrectly, come to the office hours of either Prof Hoffmann
or Prof Kindlmann, or email cs154-profs@googlegroups.com if your schedule
prevents you from coming to their office hours. If we change the grade
because we think there was in fact a grading error, the grade may go
up or down.  You have two weeks (from when exam1 grades are returned)
to bring our attention to exam1 grading errors.
