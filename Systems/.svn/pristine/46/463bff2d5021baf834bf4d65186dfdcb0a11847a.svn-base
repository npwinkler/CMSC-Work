For this project (and only this project) you will not be using svn to
check out or submit any code.  As described in the assignment, you
request bombs through the bomb server, and proceed to work on them,
and the bombs will record your progress on the bomb score board.

We are providing this directory so that you have a place to keep your
bomb and whatever partial solutions you want to maintain as you work
through the various phases.
