Homework 7 Note

To deal with the typdef placement issues, 
separate lookup.h, lookup.c, and test_lookup.c files were made for accounts and ints.
All of the account ones are the specified file names with an a at the end.
All of the integer ones are the specified file names with an i at the end.

The ONLY differences in these files are the typedefs and print functions, 
everything is still done in terms of ValueType. Every single change is noted.
The table works for general types, this was just the easiest way to test two types
and means one does not have to manually manipulate typedef at compile time.

Further clarification:
to test test_lookup with accounts, "gcc test_lookupa.c lookupa.c"
to test test_lookup with ints, "gcc test_lookupi.c lookupi.c"
to test tsl, "gcc tsl.c lookupa.c"
