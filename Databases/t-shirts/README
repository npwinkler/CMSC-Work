/* T-Shirt Sales Database Usage */
When ordering shirts for my house's t-shirt sales, I took a Google Poll, imported the data into a .csv so it could be read
by sqlite. Then, I automatically rather than manually found out how many shirts of each color and size combination I needed
to order as well as checked for null values and improper input to be able to re-contact the right people.
